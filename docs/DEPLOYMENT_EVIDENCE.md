# Deployment Evidence — 12 November 2026

## Supplied local installation report

| Field | Reported value | Evidence status |
|---|---|---|
| Host/device | Hive, Windows | Local report |
| Board | Arduino UNO / ATmega328P | Reported identification |
| Port | COM8 | Reported identification |
| Source path | Not retained in repository | Privacy minimization |
| Source SHA-256 | `162BB11166AD2BF11EFBE75F37F1EB868AF1A15500C0A31EDBD1B5DC25601518` | Independently recomputed from local source during audit |
| Flash | 12,204 bytes | Reported build metric |
| Static SRAM | 1,564 bytes | Reported build metric |
| Nominal SRAM remaining | 484 bytes | Derived from 2,048-byte capacity |
| Upload | Successful | Supplied report; raw uploader transcript/readback checksum not supplied |
| OLED / controls / long-run runtime | Not verified | Outstanding |

The associated local source is preserved at `firmware/archive/installed-snapshot-2026-11-12/QUANTA2.ino`.

## Evidence distinctions

- A source SHA-256 is not a compiled HEX/BIN SHA-256.
- A success message is not flash readback verification.
- USB re-enumeration does not prove OLED/peripheral behavior.
- Historical memory metrics do not automatically apply to canonical or archived variants.
- No measured FPS, multi-hour soak, stack high-water, or numerical reference comparison is present in the supplied evidence.

## Required next hardware record

Capture exact Git commit/source SHA-256, CLI/core/FQBN, build memory output, board revision/port, complete upload output including verify result, OLED controller/address/wiring, evidence of all display pages, button/buzzer behavior, FPS, resets, duration, stack high-water, and numerical norm/error logs. Do not mark unperformed tests passed.
